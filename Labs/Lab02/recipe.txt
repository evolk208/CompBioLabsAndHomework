Betty Crocker Oatmeal-Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe 

Notes: Super delicious cookie recipe! Granulated sugar made cookies potentially too sweet.

Ingredients: 
1.5 cups packed brown sugar 
1 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla 
1 egg 
2 cups quick-cooking oats 
1.5 cups all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
.25 teaspoon salt 
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Steps: 
1. Heat oven to 350Â°F. In large bowl, stir brown sugar and butter until blended. Stir in vanilla and egg until light and fluffy. Stir in oats, flour, baking soda and salt; stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
2. Onto un-greased cookie sheet, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart.
3. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack.
Optional addition: Stir in old-fashioned oats for chewier cookies, along with a dash of ground cinnamon or ginger for a bit of spice.
