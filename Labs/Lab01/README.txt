A description of the data files found in this directory for Lab 01 of EBIO 4420/5420

1. BirdList.txt
Bird species list from 
http://www.birdphotography.com/birdlist.html
accessed: 1/18/17
this is a list of birds that the website author has photographed

Each line of the file is either a species of bird (tab indented) or a family of birds (non-indented)

2. PredPreyData.csv
This is an output of simulation data generated from a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model as coded by Sam.
It was a generated using the deSolve package in R.
The parameter values were as follows:
totalGenerations <- 1000
initPrey <- 100 		# initial prey abundance
initPred <- 10		# initial predator abundance
a <- 0.01 			# attack rate
r <- 0.2 			# growth rate of prey
m <- 0.05 		# mortality rate of predators
k <- 0.1 		# conversion constant of prey into predators

It has four columns.  The first is the "row names" as generated by default by R in the construction and writing of the data frame object that stored these data.

The second column is the time step

The third column is the abundance of prey at a given time

The fourth column is the abundance of predators at a given time
