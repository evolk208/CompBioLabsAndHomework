## Note to students:
## This file is meant to demonstrate how Sam suggests you set up the file of your code
## when you are writing your own functions
############


# For a given problem, first write the function:

# Hypothetical Problem (NOT a real problem in the actual lab)
# Write a function that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle
# when given the other two sides:
myHypFunc <- function(a, b) {
    # two sides, a and b, must be given
    # square one side (a^2), square the second side (b^2), and
    # then sum those two squares
    mysum <- a^2 + b^2
    # take the square root of that sum
    myHypotenuse <- sqrt( mysum )
    return( myHypotenuse )
}

# THEN, give test cases of the function's usage:

# Demonstrate that it works:
# Suppose a triangle with sides 3 and 4; we expect the hypotenuse to be 5
myHypFunc(3, 4)
myHypFunc(30, 40)
myHypFunc(10, 10)
sqrt(2) == myHypFunc(1,1)

# Then, move on to the next problem

# Problem 1.  Area of a triangle when given base and height

# Function definition:


# Demonstration of usage:

# Problem #2.  Our own absolute value function
# and so on ....
